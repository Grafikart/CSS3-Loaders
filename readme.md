# CSS3 Animated loader

A collection of animated CSS3 only loaders.

## I want to create a new loader ?

If you want to participate in this project and create a new loader effect you can create a new .scss file and import it in the main app.scss (name your file as your class name, prefixed by loader-).
For instance if you want to create a square loader name it .loader-square and create a new file _loader-square.scss

## Todo

- Remove bourbon dependencies (maybe using a bette library like compass with animation support)
